  Figure 1: This graph represents the various maximum speeds, in miles per hour, achievable by each gear at various engine RPMs.
</h6>

The purpose of this research was to show the mechanical advantage of each gear and their corresponding theoretical maximum speeds. After thoughtful analysis, it is determined that this data is accurate and be backed up with manufacturer data. Additionally, you can test this hypothesis yourself. According to the graph, on first gear and 2000 rpm, your car's speed will be about 10mph. If you let your car off the brake, from parking, without the accelerator, your car should reach close to 10mph near 2000rpm.
