  Figure 1: This graph represents the various maximum speeds, in miles per hour, achievable by each gear at various engine RPMs.

### The purpose of this research is to illustrate the mechanical advantage of each gear and its corresponding theoretical maximum speeds. After careful analysis, it has been determined that this data is accurate and can be substantiated with manufacturer data. Additionally, you can test this hypothesis yourself. According to the graph, at first gear and 2000 rpm, your car's speed should be about 10 mph. If you release your car from the brake, starting from a parked position, without pressing the accelerator, your car should reach close to 10 mph at around 2000 rpm.
